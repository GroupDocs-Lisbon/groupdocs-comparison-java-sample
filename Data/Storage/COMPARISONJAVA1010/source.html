The IPAs and medical groups in Trio ACO HMO participate in accountable care organization collaborations with Blue Shield. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. This Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) Evidence of Coverage describes the health care coverage that is provided under the Group Health Service Contract between Blue Shield and the Contractholder (Employer). A Summary of Benefits is provided with, and is incorporated as part of, this Evidence of Coverage. Please read this Evidence of Coverage and Summary of Benefits carefully. Together they explain which services are covered and which are excluded. They also contain information about the role of the Personal Physician in the coordination and authorization of Covered Services and Member responsibilities such as payment of Copayments, Coinsurance and Deductibles. Capitalized terms in this Evidence of Coverage have a special meaning. Please see the Definitions section for a clear understanding of these terms. Members may contact Blue Shield Customer Service with questions about their Benefits. Contact information can be found on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. Variable language. Applicable to: Channel: On Exchange [This health Plan is offered through Covered California for Small Business (CCSB). For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network.

Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at&nbsp; [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA.&nbsp; The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision.

Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network. Contact Customer Service to receive information regarding eligibility criteria and the written policy and procedure for requesting continuity of care from a terminated provider.

The IPAs and medical groups in Trio ACO HMO participate in accountable care organization collaborations with Blue Shield. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. This Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) Evidence of Coverage describes the health care coverage that is provided under the Group Health Service Contract between Blue Shield and the Contractholder (Employer). A Summary of Benefits is provided with, and is incorporated as part of, this Evidence of Coverage. Please read this Evidence of Coverage and Summary of Benefits carefully. Together they explain which services are covered and which are excluded. They also contain information about the role of the Personal Physician in the coordination and authorization of Covered Services and Member responsibilities such as payment of Copayments, Coinsurance and Deductibles. Capitalized terms in this Evidence of Coverage have a special meaning. Please see the Definitions section for a clear understanding of these terms. Members may contact Blue Shield Customer Service with questions about their Benefits. Contact information can be found on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. Variable language.

For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission.

The IPAs and medical groups in Trio ACO HMO participate in accountable care organization collaborations with Blue Shield. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. This Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) Evidence of Coverage describes the health care coverage that is provided under the Group Health Service Contract between Blue Shield and the Contractholder (Employer). A Summary of Benefits is provided with, and is incorporated as part of, this Evidence of Coverage. Please read this Evidence of Coverage and Summary of Benefits carefully. Together they explain which services are covered and which are excluded. They also contain information about the role of the Personal Physician in the coordination and authorization of Covered Services and Member responsibilities such as payment of Copayments, Coinsurance and Deductibles. Capitalized terms in this Evidence of Coverage have a special meaning. Please see the Definitions section for a clear understanding of these terms. Members may contact Blue Shield Customer Service with questions about their Benefits. Contact information can be found on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. Variable language. Applicable to: Channel: On Exchange [This health Plan is offered through Covered California for Small Business (CCSB). For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network. Contact Customer Service to receive information regarding eligibility criteria and the written policy and procedure for requesting continuity of care from a terminated provider.

Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician.&nbsp; All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling&nbsp; [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at&nbsp; [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA.&nbsp; The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied.

For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network.

The IPAs and medical groups in Trio ACO HMO participate in accountable care organization collaborations with Blue Shield. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. This Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) Evidence of Coverage describes the health care coverage that is provided under the Group Health Service Contract between Blue Shield and the Contractholder (Employer). A Summary of Benefits is provided with, and is incorporated as part of, this Evidence of Coverage. Please read this Evidence of Coverage and Summary of Benefits carefully. Together they explain which services are covered and which are excluded. They also contain information about the role of the Personal Physician in the coordination and authorization of Covered Services and Member responsibilities such as payment of Copayments, Coinsurance and Deductibles. Capitalized terms in this Evidence of Coverage have a special meaning. Please see the Definitions section for a clear understanding of these terms. Members may contact Blue Shield Customer Service with questions about their Benefits. Contact information can be found on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. Variable language. Applicable to: Channel: On Exchange [This health Plan is offered through Covered California for Small Business (CCSB). For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network.

Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network. Contact Customer Service to receive information regarding eligibility criteria and the written policy and procedure for requesting continuity of care from a terminated provider. Continuity of Care for New Members by Non-Contracting Providers</p><p>Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections.&nbsp; Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician.&nbsp; See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician.&nbsp; All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph.

Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling&nbsp; [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at&nbsp; [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA.&nbsp; The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission.

For more information about Covered California for Small Business, please visit www.coveredca.com or call 1-888-975-1142.] How to Use This Health Plan PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. Selecting a Personal Physician Each Member must select a general practitioner, family practitioner, internist, obstetrician/gynecologist, or pediatrician as their Personal Physician at the time of enrollment. Individual Family members must also designate a Personal Physician, but each may select a different provider as their Personal Physician. A list of Blue Shield Trio ACO HMO Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members may also call the Customer Service Department at the telephone number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a Personal Physician. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician must be located sufficiently close to the Member&rsquo;s home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Blue Shield. If the Member does not select a Personal Physician at the time of enrollment, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician and the Member will be notified. This designation will remain in effect until the Member requests a change. A Personal Physician must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. The selection may be made prior to the birth or placement for adoption and a pediatrician may be selected as the Personal Physician. For the month of birth, the Personal Physician must be in the same Medical Group or Independent Practice Association (IPA) as the mother&rsquo;s Personal Physician when the newborn is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the Subscriber for adoption, the Personal Physician selected must be a Physician in the same Medical Group or IPA as the Subscriber. If a Personal Physician is not selected for the child, Blue Shield will designate a Personal Physician from the same Medical Group or IPA as the natural mother or the Subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adoption occurred. To change the Personal Physician for the child after the first month, see the section below on Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA. The child must be enrolled with Blue Shield to continue coverage beyond the first 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. See the Eligibility and Enrollment section for additional information. Personal Physician Relationship The Physician-patient relationship is an important element of an HMO Plan. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician will make every effort to ensure that all Medically Necessary and appropriate professional services are provided in a manner compatible with the Member&rsquo;s wishes. If the Member and Personal Physician fail to establish a satisfactory relationship or disagree on a recommended course of treatment, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage for assistance in selecting a new Personal Physician. If a Member is not able to establish a satisfactory relationship with his or her Personal Physician, Blue Shield will provide access to other available Personal Physicians. Members who repeatedly fail to establish a satisfactory relationship with a Personal Physician may lose eligibility for enrollment in the Plan. Prior to taking disenrollment action, Blue Shield will provide the Member with a written warning that describes the unacceptable conduct and gives the Member an opportunity to respond. Role of the Personal Physician The Personal Physician chosen by the Member at the time of enrollment will coordinate all Covered Services including primary care, preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan Specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services, Access+ Specialist, and Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services), Hospice admission through a Participating Hospice Agency, Emergency Services, Urgent Services and Hospital admission. The Personal Physician will also manage prior authorization when needed. Because Physicians and other Health Care Providers set aside time for scheduled appointments, the Member should notify the provider&rsquo;s office within 24 hours if unable to keep an appointment. Some offices may charge a fee (not to exceed the Member&rsquo;s Copayment or Coinsurance) unless the missed appointment was due to an emergency situation or 24-hour advance notice is provided. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) Covered Services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician who is not her designated Personal Physician without a referral from the Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA. However, the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician must be in the same Medical Group/IPA as the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as Physician services related to: 1) prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, 2) diagnose and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and genitalia, 3) treatment of disorders of the breast, 4) routine annual gynecological/well-woman examinations. Obstetrical/Gynecological Physician services are separate from the Access+ Specialist feature described later in this section. Referral to Specialty Services Although self-referral to Plan Specialists is available through the Access+ Specialist feature, Blue Shield encourages Members to receive specialty services through a referral from their Personal Physician. When the Personal Physician determines that specialty services, including laboratory and X-ray, are Medically Necessary, he or she will initiate a referral to a designated Plan Provider and request necessary authorizations. The Personal Physician will generally refer the Member to a Specialist or other Health Care Provider within the same Medical Group/IPA. The Specialist or other Health Care Provider will send a report to the Personal Physician after the consultation so that the Member&rsquo;s medical record is complete. In the event no Plan Provider is available to perform the needed services, the Personal Physician will refer the Member to a non-Plan Provider after obtaining authorization. Specialty services are subject to all benefit and eligibility provisions, exclusions and limitations described in this Evidence of Coverage. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment and Substance Use Disorder Services. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Blue Shield HMO Personal Physicians contract with a Medical Group or IPA to share administrative and authorization responsibilities (some Personal Physicians contract directly with Blue Shield). The Personal Physician coordinates the Member&rsquo;s care within the Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA and directs referrals to Medical Group/IPA Specialists or Hospitals, unless care for the Member&rsquo;s health condition is unavailable within the Medical Group/IPA. The Member&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA ensures that a full panel of Specialists is available and assists the Personal Physician with utilization management of Plan Benefits. Medical Groups/IPAs also have admitting arrangements with Blue Shield&rsquo;s contracted Hospitals within their service area. The Medical Group/IPA also works with the Personal Physician to authorize Covered Services and ensure that Covered Services are performed by Plan Providers. The Member should contact Member Services if the Member needs assistance locating a Plan Provider in the Member&rsquo;s Service Area. The Plan will review and consider a Member&rsquo;s request for services that cannot be reasonably obtained in network. If a Member&rsquo;s request for services from a Non-Plan Provider is approved, the Plan will pay for Covered Services from the Non-Plan Provider. The Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician and Medical Group/IPA are listed on the Member&rsquo;s identification (ID) card. Changing Personal Physicians or Designated Medical Group or IPA The Trio ACO HMO Plan offers a limited selection of IPAs and Medical Groups from which Members must choose. Members may change their Personal Physician to another Personal Physician within their selected Medical Group/IPA by calling Shield Concierge at the number provided on the back of this Evidence of Coverage, on the back of the ID Card, or by submitting a request through the Blue Shield member portal. It is important for Members to review the list of providers within the Trio ACO HMO Physician and Hospital Directory before enrolling in this Plan. In many areas, there may only be one (1) IPA or Medical Group from which to select a Personal Physician or to receive Covered Services. In scenarios where there is only one (1) IPA or Medical Group, Members may not change their Trio ACO HMO Medical Group/IPA except by enrolling in a different health plan, either at open enrollment or as the result of a qualifying event. In some circumstances, however, more than one Medical Group/IPA serves a particular area. In such situations, Members may change their selected Medical Group/IPA to another Medical Group/IPA the same way they change their Personal Physician. If the selected Medical Group/IPA does not have an affiliation with the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician, a change in Medical Group/IPA may also require the Member to select a new Personal Physician. Changes in Medical Group/IPA or Personal Physician are effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Blue Shield. Once the change of Personal Physician is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new Personal Physician, except for OB/GYN services and Access+ Specialist visits as noted in earlier sections. Once the Medical Group/IPA change is effective, authorizations for Covered Services provided by the former Medical Group/IPA are no longer valid. Care must be transitioned to specialists within the new Medical Group/IPA, and except for Access+ Specialist visits, new authorizations must be obtained. Members may call Customer Service for assistance with Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA changes. Voluntary Medical Group/IPA changes are not permitted while the Member is confined to a Hospital or during the third trimester of pregnancy. The effective date of the new Medical Group/IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the Hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of postpartum care. Additionally, changes in Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA during an on-going course of treatment may interrupt care. For this reason, the effective date of a Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA change, when requested during an on-going course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer the Member&rsquo;s care to a new Personal Physician or Medical Group/IPA, as determined by Blue Shield. Exceptions must be approved by a Blue Shield Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provisions, please contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of this Evidence of Coverage. If a Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician terminates participation in the Plan, Blue Shield will notify the Member in writing and designate a new Personal Physician who is immediately available to provide the Member&rsquo;s medical care. Members may also make their own selection of a new Personal Physician within 15 days of this notification. The Member&rsquo;s selection must be approved by Blue Shield prior to receiving any Covered Services under the Plan. Access+ Specialist The Member may arrange an office visit with an Access+ Plan Specialist within their Personal Physician&rsquo;s Medical Group/IPA without a referral from the Personal Physician. The Member is responsible for the Copayment or Coinsurance listed in the Summary of Benefits for each Access+ Specialist visit including the initial visit and follow up care not referred through the Member&rsquo;s Personal Physician. See the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services section for information regarding Access+ Specialist visits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services. An Access+ Specialist visit includes: 1) An examination or other consultation including diagnosis and treatment provided by a Medical Group or IPA Plan Specialist without a Personal Physician referral; 2) Conventional X-rays (diagnostic and nuclear imaging such as CT, MRI, or bone density measurement is not included); 3) Laboratory services; An Access+ Specialist visit does not include: 1) Services which are not otherwise covered; 2) Services provided by a non-Access+ Provider (such as Podiatry and Physical Therapy), except for X-ray and laboratory services as described above; 3) Allergy testing; 4) Endoscopic procedures; 5) Diagnostic and nuclear imaging including CT, MRI, or bone density measurement; 6) Injectables, chemotherapy, or other infusion drugs, other than vaccines and antibiotics; 7) Infertility services; 8) Emergency Services; 9) Urgent Services; 10) Inpatient services, or any services which result in a facility charge, except for routine X-ray and laboratory services; 11) Services for which the Medical Group or IPA routinely allows the Member to self-refer without authorization from the Personal Physician; 12) OB/GYN services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice Physician within the same Medical Group/IPA as the Personal Physician. Access+ Satisfaction Members may provide Blue Shield with feedback regarding the service received from Plan Physicians. If a Member is dissatisfied with the service provided during an office visit with a Plan Physician, the Member may contact Customer Service at the number provided on the back page of the Evidence of Coverage to request a refund of the office visit Copayment or Coinsurance, as shown in the Summary of Benefits under Physician services. Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services Blue Shield contracts with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through a unique network of MHSA Participating Providers. All non-emergency Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Hospital admissions and Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health Treatment, and Outpatient Substance Use Disorder Services, except for Access+ Specialist visits, must be arranged through and authorized by the MHSA. Members are not required to coordinate Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services through their Personal Physician. All Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services must be provided by an MHSA Participating Provider, apart from the exceptions noted in the next paragraph. Information regarding MHSA Participating Providers is available online at www.blueshieldca.com. Members, or their Personal Physician, may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select an MHSA Participating Provider by calling [1-877-263-9952]. Your Personal Physician may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding the MHSA Participating Providers. Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services received from an MHSA Non-Participating Provider will not be covered except as an Emergency or Urgent Service or when no MHSA Participating Provider is available to perform the needed services and the MHSA refers the Member to an MHSA Non-Participating Provider and authorizes the services. Except for these stated exceptions, all charges for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, or Substance Use Disorder Services not rendered by an MHSA Participating Provider will be the Member&rsquo;s responsibility. For complete information regarding Benefits for Mental Health Services, Behavioral Health Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Services, see the Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Benefits section. Prior Authorization for Mental Health, Behavioral Health, and Substance Use Disorder Services The MHSA Participating Provider must obtain prior authorization for all non-emergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Blue Shield&rsquo;s Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at [1-877-263-9952] at least five business days prior to the admission. Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also be prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: 1) for Urgent Services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member&rsquo;s condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; 2) for other services, within five business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and Member within two business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non-Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, coverage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Continuity of Care by a Terminated Provider Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a terminated provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Blue Shield provider network. Contact Customer Service to receive information regarding eligibility criteria and the written policy and procedure for requesting continuity of care from a terminated provider. Continuity of Care for New Members by Non-Contracting Providers Newly covered Members who (1) are being treated for acute conditions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; (2) are children from birth to 36 months of age; or (3) have received authorization from a provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with the non-contracting provider who was providing services to the Member at the time the Member&rsquo;s coverage became effective under this Plan.
