Hi Pat,

I am very happy to stay with your family this summer and thankful for your invitation. And my friend also would love to come. We are going to come in early July. Is this convenient for you and your family?

You don't know my friend. Her name is Anna. Do you remember a photo I sent you after graduating from college? She was on it. We studied together in college. She's blonde and was dressed in red at this photo. She is a very good person. She loves listening to music and dancing, as well as I do.

Thank you again for your invitation. I'm looking forward to seeing you and your family this summer. I've told Anna about you and she really want to meet you too. Please let me know if we can come in early July.

Lots of love,
Elena.
